Class loaders in Java:

System class loader: loads classes from classpath
Extenstion class loader: 

a class can extent only one abstract class but can implement multiple interfaces
abstract class has instance varibles but interfaces can have only constants




===============================Spring boot=====================================================
IOC: Inversion of control. Moving the control of creating the objects to IOC container in spring
Bean: Plain java objects
Spring bean is mainained by IOC container
 1. Container gets started
 2. Container creates beans
 3. Dependencis are created
 4. Dependencis are injected
 5. Destories the dependencies

@singleton: Only one Bean per application context
@prototype: New bean every request
@request: new bean every http request
@component: simplest form of dependency
@autowire:  injects the dependency automatically(setter,constructor & field injection)
@qualifier(qualifiername): based on the qualifier we can select the bean
@Primary: bean will be selected based on this qualitier

@Inject is a standard annotaion but @Autowire is spring specifc

@SpringBootApplication = @Configuarion + @EnableAutoConfiguarion + @ComponentScan

By Default scan happens in the package where @SpringBootApplication is present. 

@ComponentScan is used to scan the packages in different packages other than where @SpringBootApplication is defined. 
@PostConstruct: Used to perform some action immediately after a bean is created. Used to initialize things for the bean
 examples: Caching data
 
@PreDestory: Invoked just before the bean is destroyed

If we dont want to use PostConstruct and PreDestory then implement the interfaces InitializingBean and DisposableBean 
and override the methods to get same behavior

XMLBeanFactory: Actual conatiner that insantiates configures and manages number of beans



PostConstruct and PreDestory used to Manage Prototype bean due overwhelming creation of beans of type prototype

Spring way:

<bean id="contentBasedFilter" 
  class="io.datajek.spring.basics.movierecommendersystem.lesson14.ContentBasedFilter">
</bean>

<bean id="collaborativeFilter" 
  class="io.datajek.spring.basics.movierecommendersystem.lesson14.CollaborativeFilter"> 
</bean>

<bean id="recommenderImplementation"     
  class="io.datajek.spring.basics.movierecommendersystem.lesson14.RecommenderImplementation">
</bean>


ClassPathXmlApplicationContext appContext = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("appContext.xml");

@Controller: Web layer
@Service: business layer
@Repository: database layer 

@Value annotation to bind values in app.properties file to property in class;


SpringbootStarter:
starter web: building web and restful applications

@Controller: Java calss to map uri to path
@RestController: 

@RequestMapping(method=RequestMethod.GET, value="/movies")
//OR
@GetMapping("/movies")
public List<Movie> getAllMovies() {
    //...
}

 Developer tools: supports live reloads
 
 Actuator: Monitoring health of springboot application
 
  http://localhost:8080/actuator or  http://localhost:8080/application(old release)
  
  By Default actuator endpoints are disabled. To enable
  management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
  
  
  public List<Player> getAllPlayers() {
  String sql = "SELECT * FROM PLAYER";
  return jdbcTemplate.query(sql, new BeanPropertyRowMapper<Player> (Player.class));
}

@Entity: Define pojo as db entity
@GeneratedValue: Used for sequences

@Repository: To manager the entities
@Repository
@Transactional
public class PlayerRepository{

@PersistenceContext
  EntityManager entityManager;
}

A JPA EntityManager manages connection to a database as well as to database operations. 
EntityManager is associated with a PersistenceContext. 
All operations that are performed in a specific session are stored inside the PersistenceContext. 
EntityManager is the interface to the Persistence Context. 
All operations on the entity go through the EntityManager. 
We will declare an EntityManager object in our class and mark it with the @PersistenceContext annotation.


Merge,
findByiD
remove



	@Repository
@Transactional
public class PlayerRepository {
	
	@PersistenceContext
	EntityManager entityManager;

 	public Player insertPlayer(Player player){
		return entityManager.merge(player);
	}

	public Player updatePlayer(Player player){
		return entityManager.merge(player);
	}

	public Player getPlayerById(int id) {
	    return entityManager.find(Player.class, id);			    
	}

	public void deletePlayerById(int id){
		Player player = entityManager.find(Player.class, id);
		entityManager.remove(player);

}


SpringDataJpa

public interface PlayerSpringDataRepository extends JpaRepository<Player, Integer>{

  //no implementation required!
}


AutoWire the above class to perform db operations

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none 
spring.datasource.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/movie_example
spring.datasource.username = demo
spring.datasource.password = demo





A Java object (POJO) can be converted into a JSON object and vice versa through a process called data binding. We can read JSON and use it to populate a Java object. In the same manner, we can use a Java object to create JSON.

@JsonIgnoreProperties: Can be used to bypass exception by setting IgnoreUnknown to true. This feature is useful when the JSON file contains more properties but we are only interested in a few of them.


Player Controller:
package io.datajek.springrest;

import java.util.List;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class PlayerController {

	@Autowired
	PlayerService service;
	
	@GetMapping("/welcome")
	public String welcome() {
	    return "Tennis Player REST API";
	}

	@GetMapping("/players")
	public List<Player> allPlayers() {
		return service.getAllPlayers();	    
	}
	
	
	@GetMapping("/players/{id}")
	public Player getPlayer(@PathVariable int id){
		return service.getPlayer(id);
	}
}

PlayerService:

package io.datajek.springrest;

import java.util.List;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class PlayerService {
	
	@Autowired
	PlayerRepository repo;
	
	//Get all players
	public List<Player> getAllPlayers() {
		return repo.findAll();	    
	}

	
	//Get player by ID
	
	//Add a player
	
	//Update a player
	
	//Partial update
	
	//delete a player
}

PlayerRepository:

package io.datajek.springrest;

import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;

public interface PlayerRepository extends JpaRepository<Player, Integer>{
	
}


@PathVariable annotation binds the path variable {id} from the URL to the method parameter id
@GetMapping("/players/{id}")
public Player getPlayer() {
    //call service layer method
}

The @RequestBody annotation handles this conversion and binds the data in the request body to a method parameter.

{
  "name": "Federer",
  "nationality": "Switzerland",
  "birthDate": "22-11-1984",
  "titles": 151
}


@PutMapping("/players/{id}")
public Player updatePlayer(@PathVariable int id, @RequestBody Player player) {
 
}

@ControllerAdvice
A best practice in exception handling is to have centralized exception handlers that can be used by all controllers in the REST API. 
Since exception handling is a cross-cutting concern, Spring provides the @ControllerAdvice annotation.
This annotation intercepts requests going to the controller and responses coming from controllers.

package io.datajek.springrest;

import java.time.ZonedDateTime;

import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;

import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;

one to one mapping

@Entity
public class Player {

	@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
	private int id;

	private String name;
    
    @OneToOne(cascade=CascadeType.ALL)//, optional = false) 
    @JoinColumn(name = "profile_id", referencedColumnName = "id")
    private PlayerProfile playerProfile;
  
    public Player( ) {
    
    }
    
    public Player(String name) {
		super();
		this.name = name;
	}
    
    public Player(String name, PlayerProfile profile) {
		super();

	}

	@Override
	public String toString() {
		return "Player [id=" + id + ", name=" + name + ", playerProfile=" + playerProfile + "]";
	}
}


Recursion issue:

To solve this issue, we can use the @JsonManagedReference and @JsonBackReference annotations in the classes. As a result, only the owning side of the relationship is serialized and the inverse side is not serialized.

The @JsonManagedReference annotation is used on the playerProfile field in the owning side (Player class). On the inverse side (PlayerProfile class), the @JsonBackReference annotation is used to the player field. These annotations solve the infinite recursion problem.

OneToMany:

@Entity
public class Tournament {
	@Id
	@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
	private int id;

	private String name;
	private String location;
	
	@OneToMany(cascade=CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval=true)//, orphanRemoval=true)
	@JoinColumn(name="tournament_id")
	private List<Registration> registrations = new ArrayList<>();

	public Tournament() {

	public Tournament(String name, String location) {
		super();
		this.name = name;
		this.location = location;
	}
	
	public Tournament(String name, String location, List<Registration> registrations) {
		super();
		this.name = name;
		this.location = location;
		this.registrations = registrations;
	}
	
	public int getId() {
		return id;
	}

	public void setId(int id) {
		this.id = id;
	}

	public String getName() {
		return name;
	}

	public void setName(String name) {
		this.name = name;

	public String getLocation() {
		return location;
	}

	public void setLocation(String location) {
		this.location = location;
	}

	public List<Registration> getRegistrations() {
		return registrations;
	}

	public void setRegistrations(List<Registration> registrations) {
		this.registrations = registrations;
	}

	//set up one to many relationship
	public void addRegistration(Registration reg) {
    	registrations.add(reg);
    }
	
	//remove registration 
	public void removeRegistration(Registration reg) {
    	if (registrations != null)
    		registrations.remove(reg);
	}

	@Override

}



AOP:
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
   <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-aop</artifactId>
</dependency>

Aspect
An aspect is a Java class that implements cross-cutting concerns.
 The @Aspect annotation is used to define a class as an aspect. 
 An aspect is a combination of the kinds of methods to intercept and what to do after intercepting them.
 
 Pointcut
Pointcuts are expressions that determine which method calls will be intercepted. 
These expressions determine whether an advice needs to be executed or not.
 Pointcuts are defined following a particular syntax.
 
 Joinpoint
All method calls that are intercepted are joinpoints. 
It is a point in the program execution where an aspect can be plugged in. 
It contains the name of the intercepted method call. 
 
 
Weaving
The process of implementing AOP around method calls is called weaving. 
Weaving links an aspect with objects in the application to create an advised object. 
The aspect is called at the right moment. 
For example, if we are tracking the execution time of some methods in our application, the weaving process will be like this:



JUNIT life cycle annotations
@BeforeEach
Before a test is run, some initialization is needed. In the test cases that we wrote, we created a new instance of the class in every test. A method with the @BeforeEach annotation is executed once before every test method executes. We can initialize the objects or establish a database connection before each test in a method annotated with @BeforeEach. With JUnit, there is no guarantee about the order in which the tests are run. 
But, it is guaranteed that no matter the order of tests, @BeforeEach is run before the test is run.

@AfterEach
Similar to @BeforeEach, the @AfterEach annotation tells JUnit to run the method after a test has been executed.

@BeforeAll
A method annotated with @BeforeAll is run once before all test methods of the class are executed. It is a setup method and has to be static. 
This method is executed even before the instance of the class to be tested is created.

@AfterAll
Just like the @BeforeAll annotation, the @AfterAll annotation on a method ensures that it is run after all the tests have been run. It executes after all test methods of the class are executed. 
This method is a class-level method and is, therefore, static.


@Test
void testfindTotal() {
  StudentDao studentDaoMock = mock(StudentDao.class);
  when(studentDaoMock.getMarks()).thenReturn(new int[] {15, 20, 5});

  StudentService studentService = new StudentService(studentDaoMock);
  int total = studentService.findTotal();
assertEquals(40, total);
}


@Mock
The @Mock annotation is used to create a mock without calling the Mockito.mock() method.


@InjectMocks
This annotation automatically injects a mock object into the object being tested. 
We have been passing the mock object to the StudentService object as a constructor argument in the test method as follows:



The annotation @ConditionalOnMissingBean tells Spring Boot to configure the bean only if the supplied bean in the parameter is not configured and registered in the application context already.


@EnableEurekaClient: To enable a microservice to register itself as eureka client during service discover;
@EnableEurekaServer: To enable discovery services for client to register. 


Spring security:

request-> filter->AuthenticationManager->ProviderManager->AuthProvider->UserDetailsService(loadUserByUsername)

if you want to authenticate using your custom user and password. Then IMplement custom configuration class that 
extends WebSecurityConfiguerAdapter and override configrue method.
We can use password encoder to encode your passwords for example bcrypt encoder 

@Service
public class CustomUserDetailsService implements UserDetailsService {

    // Example: A list of users, in a real-world application this would be replaced with a database
    private List<UserDetails> users = new ArrayList<>();

    public CustomUserDetailsService() {
        // Adding a couple of sample users
        users.add(User.withDefaultPasswordEncoder().username("user").password("password").roles("USER").build());
        users.add(User.withDefaultPasswordEncoder().username("admin").password("password").roles("ADMIN").build());
    }

    @Override
    public UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String username) throws UsernameNotFoundException {
        return users.stream()
                .filter(user -> user.getUsername().equals(username))
                .findFirst()
                .orElseThrow(() -> new UsernameNotFoundException("User not found: " + username));
    }
}

                .and()
            .formLogin()
                .loginPage("/login") // Custom login page
                .permitAll() // Allow everyone to see the login page
                .and()
            .logout()
                .permitAll(); // Allow everyone to logout
    }

Class Annotations:

Explanation:
1.	Class Annotations:
 @Configuration: Indicates that the class is a source of bean definitions.
 	@EnableWebSecurity: Enables Spring Security's web security support.
2.	configure(HttpSecurity http):
 	Defines which URL paths should be secured and which should be publicly accessible.
 	Specifies custom login and logout configurations.
3.	configure(WebSecurity web):
 	Configures WebSecurity to ignore certain requests, such as static resources, to improve performance.
Key Components:
 	authorizeRequests(): Used to restrict access based on URL patterns.
 	formLogin(): Configures form-based authentication.
 	logout(): Configures logout functionality.
 	ignoring(): Specifies paths to be ignored by Spring Security.
This example provides a basic setup. Depending on your application requirements, you might need to add more configurations, such as user roles, additional security measures, or custom authentication providers.

@EnableMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled=true) to preauthorize requests per restful mapping

CSRF: Cross Site requets forgery. CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is a type of attack where unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the web application trusts.

Principal: Currently logged in user

Role: Decides what actions principal can perform

Authentication: 
Authorization:
Granted Authotrity: 

Filters: Intercept every request. Spring security puts filters and examines all request and allows/denies request

AuthenticationManager: 

Since Spring Boot relies on Spring Security’s defaults, CSRF protection is turned on by default. 
This means that the actuator endpoints that require a POST (shutdown and loggers endpoints), 
PUT or DELETE will get a 403 forbidden error when the default security configuration is in use.

Default Schema has users and authorities tables.
